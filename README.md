Aim of this project: 
To create a Google look-alike webpage using HTML and CSS

Reflection:
I spent approximately 6-7 hours across 4 days to complete this project. On the third day, I discarded my original draft and started from scratch again as my CSS style sheet has became increasingly disorganized. It was tedious to comb through all the code messily scattered throughout the document, hence I thought it would be easier to simply restart my progress. Not all was lost because I now had gained a greater clarity on how to design the structure of the webpage. At the same time, I have learnt my lesson and will instill some form of order in all of my future code henceforth. A useful trick I discovered to organize my code was by employing the use of comments and cataloguing the code under these headings I created using the comments feature.
